1. Write a Java program to create a method that takes an integer as a parameter and
    throws an exception if the number is even.

2. Write a Java program that will take two integer numbers as input from the keyboard.
Your program should determine whether the first number is a multiple of the second
number. Your program should provide checking for the following cases:

    i. If any of the two numbers is negative.
    ii.If the first number is smaller than the second number.
    iii. If the second number is 0.

You should define appropriate user defined exception class for each of the cases
and throw an instance of the correct exception when any of the condition arises.

    public void setHeight(double x);//Sets height
    public double getHeight();//Gets height
    public void setBase(double x);//Sets base length
    public double getBase();//Gets base length
    public double getArea();//Returns the area of the triangle
Write a main function to test the program.

2. Write the definition of a class called Grade that stores the

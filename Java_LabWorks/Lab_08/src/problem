Problem: Online Payment System

Create an online payment system that supports multiple payment methods, such as Credit
Card and PayPal. The system should process payments using a common interface for
different payment methods.

Requirements:

1. Payment Method Interface:
    o Define an interface called PaymentMethod with the following methods:
     boolean authorizePayment(double amount); — Method to authorize the
    payment of the given amount. Return true if the payment is authorized,
    false otherwise.
     void processPayment(double amount); — Method to process the payment.
     void refundPayment(double amount); — Method to refund the payment.

2. CreditCard Class:
o Create a class CreditCard that implements the PaymentMethod interface.
    o Add fields for cardNumber and cardHolderName.
    o Implement the authorizePayment() method to simulate authorization by
checking if the card number is valid.
    o Implement the processPayment() method to simulate processing the payment.
    o Implement the refundPayment() method to simulate refunding the payment.

3. PayPal Class:
o Create a class PayPal that implements the PaymentMethod interface.
    o Add fields for email and password.
    o Implement the authorizePayment() method to simulate PayPal authorization
using the email and password.
   o Implement the processPayment() method to simulate processing the payment.
   o Implement the refundPayment() method to simulate refunding the payment.

4. PaymentTest Class:
o Create a PaymentTest class with a main method.
o In this class, create instances of CreditCard and PayPal.
       o Simulate the payment flow:
          1. Authorize the payment.
          2. If authorized, process the payment.
          3. refund the payment.
